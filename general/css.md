* What is RWD?
    RWD stands for Responsive Web Design. This technique is used to display the designed page perfectly on every screen size and device, for example, mobile, tablet, desktop and laptop. You don't need to create a different page for each device.

* What are the benefits of CSS sprites?
    If a web page has a large number of images that take a longer time to load because each image separately sends out an HTTP request. The concept of CSS sprites is used to reduce the loading time for a web page because it combines the various small images into one image. It reduces the number of HTTP requests and hence the loading time.
